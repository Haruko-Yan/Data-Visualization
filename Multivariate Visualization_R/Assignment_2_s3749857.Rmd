**Objective**

The objective of the original data visualisation is to show median house price and affordability by different states in the US. The target audience is the people who want to buy or sell a house.

The visualisation chosen had the following three main issues:

* This visualisation focuses on median house price and affordability, so the big pie charts which refer to the total number of households may attract the audience's attention and mislead them.
* The pie chart, the place names and prices on the right of the visualisation shows in a dense way, which may make it difficult for the audience to distinguish which pie chart corresponds to which place name and price.
* The size of the pie chart cannot show the exact total number of households.

#### Code

The following code was used to fix the issues identified in the original. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(tidyr)

# Read data
p1 <- read_excel("D:/StudyFolder/DataVisualization/Assignment2/HomePriceAndAffordability.xlsx")

# Change the unit
p1$Price <- round(p1$Price / 1000)
p1$All <- round(p1$All / 1000000, digits = 1)
p1$Percentage <- round(p1$Percentage * 100)

# Create a function for distinguishing which price level the observation belongs to
price_level <- function(x){
  vec <- c()
  for(var in x){
    if(var >= 600)
      vec <- append(vec, "$600K and More")
    else if(var >= 500 & var<=599)
      vec <- append(vec, "$500K - $599K")
    else if(var >= 400 & var<=499)

    else if(var >= 300 & var<=399)

    else if(var >= 200 & var<=299)
      vec <- append(vec, "$200K - $299K")
    else
      vec <- append(vec, "Less than $200K")
